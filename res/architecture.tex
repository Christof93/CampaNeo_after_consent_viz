  The goal of this project in terms of implementation was to build a web application, that is easily
  embeddable into a mobile application. For this reason we decided on going for a lean
  front end without too many unnecessary dependencies to keep it responsive. Among the key dependencies that
  are necessary is D3.js, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data \cite{d3}. D3
  fits the requirements of simple interoperability between data and visualisation by manipulating the DOM
  perfectly.

  Naturally a front end for the purpose of this application is not of much use without data
  and therefore a database is required. Given that the visualisation is build around a semantic knowledge
  graph, a graph database is a necessity. A great fit in this regard is RDF4j. RDF4j, a native triple
  store, offers the ability to query the knowledge graph using SPARQL. The database has also support
  for all mainstream RDF file formats \cite{rdf4j}.

  A simple use case would be a user starting the application, which initializes the D3 frontend web
  application, which in turn queries data from the database to visualize the consent page as shown in
  \autoref{fig:prototype}.
