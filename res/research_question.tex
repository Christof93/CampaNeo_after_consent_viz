The CampaNeo project is highly dependent on requesting and receiving  informed consent for sensor data sharing. 

We want to enable data owners to give informed consent and gain legal awareness through our application.

\textbf{What is the main issue?}

Data owners do not know agreement details since they take too much time to read.

\textbf{How can we solve it?}

We make the dataflow completely transparent through a visualisation.

Can we raise legal awareness of the data sharing process through transparent visualisation?
What aspects of the data should be visualised? How can we visualise user data in order to improve comprehension of the process?
