The CampaNeo project is highly dependent on requesting and receiving  informed consent for sensor data sharing. 
The more people agree to send usage data from their cars, the more value the statistical analysis will generate.
The underlying hypothesis of this work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item People are more willing to share their data if they are fully informed on what exactly they are sharing, when they are sharing it and with whom exactly they are sharing it.
    \item Data visualisations improve comprehension of consent. 
\end{itemize}
It is debatable whether current consent gathering methods really make it absolutely clear to data subjects what happens in the background after they gave their consent. According to \cite{Borgesisus_informed_consent_2015} people tend to agree to most consent requests they are confronted with.
Reading through all the agreement specifications is time-consuming. Such documents are often written in a complex language typical for legal documents.
Due to that most people who give their consent to data sharing agreements do so without understanding many details of the contract. Bechman \cite{Bechmann2014} defines this as a “culture of blind consent”. To conclude, in most cases having one’s consent, even informed, is not equivalent to having awareness.

To change this we build an application to enable data owners to give informed consent and gain legal awareness in the process. This should be achieved by making the dataflow completely transparent through a visualisation.

The research questions that address in the design process are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What aspects of the data should be visualised?
    \item How can the data be visualised in order to improve comprehension?
\end{enumerate}

%Once an appropriate prototype is implemented, the work should be targeted towards the following two research questions which can be verified during a testing phase with real users.

%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Can we raise legal awareness of the data sharing process through transparent visualisation?
%    \item Does the ability to constantly monitor one's data sharing activities make the data processor more trustworthy to data subjects?
%\end{enumerate}
