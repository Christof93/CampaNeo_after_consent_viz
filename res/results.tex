  % What are the results of the user tests?
  The testing period took place over the course of a week and comprised user tests with 15 participants.
  The age groups were quite evenly distributed between 16 and 50+ years with the majority (53.4\%) of participants in the two age groups between 16 and 26 years.
  Gender distribution was 73.3\% female, 26.7\% male. The education levels were leaning towards the higher end of spectrum with 60\% having a high school level degree or equivalent and 33.3\% a university degree.
  All participants assessed themselves to be competent with internet surfing and most spend more than 4 hours a day on the internet. Also, 80\% of the people are active on social media on a daily basis.
  
  Asked whether they have a driver's license, 80\% confirmed and 53.3\% stated that they own a car. 46\% of the participants drive daily and use the car as their main mean of transport.
  
  To assess the participants' awareness of topics surrounding data privacy we designed a set of questions that were tested before and after the usage of the visualisation tool.
  
  Here we found very interesting differences in the same question asked before and after the test.
  We asked if the participants trust companies in the EU to respect their data privacy and most indicated that they think that this is - or probably is - the case (73.3\%).
  There are 4 people that are more sceptical about GDPR adherence of companies or are not even aware of GDPR. 2 of these 4 changed their mind on this particular question after the interaction with our visualisation tool.
  
  We wanted to know how the participants react when they are asked to share their data for research and development purposes in services and applications in their daily life.
  60\% said that they sometimes or even always (6.7\%) share data when they come into such a situation.
  Recalling the reasons why they gave their consent, only 1 person admitted to read data privacy agreements and explicitly agreeing with the contract.
  46\% said they wanted to contribute to improve the user experience, but many also indicated that they felt like they had to agree to use the service (40\%), or gave their consent without realising (13\%).
  After finishing the test we asked if the participants would share data if they had the tested tool at their disposal for any kind of service or application that needs user data. 20\% changed their mind from sharing data only rarely to sharing it possibly and 33.3\% indicated that they would more likely share data when they had the tool.
  The same question more specifically targeted towards CampaNeo and sharing vehicle data like GPS location, speedometer data or fuel gauge readings gives a similar picture.
  Before the test, 53.3\% said they'd share at least selected types of data with campaigns on CampaNeo. After the interaction with the tool, 93.3\% of the participants said that they would possibly share their vehicle data.
