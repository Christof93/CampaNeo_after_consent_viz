  %How do we evaluate our implementation? What are the results of the user-tests?
  \subsection{Methodology}
  In the context of CampaNeo there are several possibilities how the developed application could be integrated into the ecosystem of the project. One option would be to install the campaign overview natively into the infotainment system of modern cars. In this way a user would be the driver of the car who checks the status of data sharing campaigns or consent agreements before or after the drive through the on-board display of his car.
  
  Another equally valid option is to provide a non-native application available on the web or for mobile devices which lets the owner of a car connect to his car and check information about campaign data sharing remotely and independently of accessing their car.
  
  To validate the posed research questions, it is not essential for the test to take place in an actual car and simulated driving environment, since the application should not be used while driving anyway. For these first tests we provide a web application which features the functionalities described above. The tests can be performed on desktop computers, laptops or other mobile devices. The test-subject will need a thorough introduction into the scenario since the use case of the application is very specific and it is very important that the situation is understood correctly.
  
  A good understanding will be important for the test-subject to tackle the tasks that comprise the first part of the test. The subject is presented with a series of simple to slightly complex tasks that revolve around answering questions about the privacy and extent of the data sharing activities.
  During the evaluation the test-subject should be observed in real time through screen sharing. Using the 'think aloud' method the test subject can inform the tester regularly about their mental process, for example they expect to be the next step towards and where they expect to find it in the application.
  
  After the task solving period, the subjects are asked to fill out a questionnaire where they rate their experience and explain problems or give suggestions for improvements.
  
  The questions are designed to give insights into the research questions. The goal is to find out whether the subject prefers the clear transparent view of all the data exchange happening or if it is more confusing and feels more invasive than the standard solution being presented with the written contract.
