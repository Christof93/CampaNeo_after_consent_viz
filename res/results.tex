  % What are the results of the user tests?
  The testing period took place over the course of a week and comprised user tests with 17 participants.
  The age groups were quite evenly distributed between 16 and 50+ years with the majority (53.9\%) of participants in the age groups between 16 and 26 years.
  Gender distribution was 70.6\% female, 29.4\% male. The education levels were leaning towards the higher end of the spectrum with 52.9\% having a high school level degree or equivalent and 41.1\% a university degree.
  All participants assessed themselves to be competent with internet surfing and most spend more than 4 hours a day on the internet. Also, 76.6\% of the people are active on social media on a daily basis.
  
  Asked whether they have a driver's license, 76.6\% confirmed and 52.9\% stated that they own a car. 47.1\% of the participants drive daily and use the car as their main mean of transport.
  
  In the testing phase we noticed that the test users had no problems solving the tasks that were given to them.
  There were only a few exceptions where tasks couldn't be solved without help. The users understood the interface mostly relying on their intuitions and recognition of symbols.
  
  After the test the participants rated the design of the application with mean score of 3.3 on a scale from 1 to 4. This shows that our first prototype was approved overall and can be improved with the insights from the test. 
  We let the users choose from a set of adjectives to describe the interaction with the application. Among the most chosen ones were ``organised'', ``innovative'' (both 70.6\%) and ``effective'' (47.1\%). The more negatively associated adjectives like ``complex'', ``hard to use'' and ``useless'' were only selected by one person each.
  80\% of the participants were ''Very satisfied`` with the user interface. 
  
  
  88.3\% of the users claimed to ``see who gets my data'' using the application and 76.5\% said the they understand better what happens to their personal data, which shows that the users become aware of the sharing process.
  However, just 47.1\% agreed that they became ``more confident in their knowledge of data sharing'' which is probably because most were already aware of the most basic GDPR rights and did not gain a lot of knowledge through the application alone. 
  
  To further assess the participants' awareness of topics surrounding data privacy we designed a set of questions that were tested before and after the usage of the visualisation tool.
  We asked if the participants trust companies in the EU to respect their data privacy and the majority said ``yes'' or ``probably'' (64.7\%).
  The remaining 6 people (35.3\%) were more sceptical about GDPR adherence of companies or were not even aware of the GDPR.
  2 of these 6 changed their mind on this particular question after the interaction with our visualisation tool.
  This indicates that they got more aware of the regulations companies must follow in the EU and felt more secure after the insights of the visualisation.
  
  We wanted to know how the participants react when they are asked to share their data for research and development purposes in services and applications in their daily life.
  58.8\% said that they sometimes or even always (5.9\%) share data when they come into such a situation.
  Recalling the reasons why they gave their consent, only 1 person admitted to read data privacy agreements and explicitly agreeing with the contract.
  41.2\% said they wanted to contribute to improve the user experience, but many also indicated that they ``felt like they had to agree to use the service'' (35.3\%), or even gave their consent without realising (11.8\%).
  After finishing the test we asked if the participants would share data if they had the tested tool at their disposal for any kind of service or application that needs user data.
  % increase of 20-30%
  23.5\% changed their mind from sharing data only rarely to sharing it possibly and 35.3\% indicated that they were more likely to share data when they had the tool than without it.
  The same question phrased more specifically towards CampaNeo and sharing vehicle data like GPS location, speedometer data or fuel gauge readings gives an even clearer picture.
  % increase of 40%
  Before the test, 58.8\% said they'd share at least selected types of data with campaigns on CampaNeo. After the interaction with the tool, 94.1\% of the participants said that they would possibly share their vehicle data if they had the tool to control the sharing activities.
