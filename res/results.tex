  %How do we evaluate our implementation? What are the results of the
  %user-tests?

  \subsection{Methodology}
  There are several possibilities how the developed
  application could be integrated into the ecosystem of the CampaNeo project.
  One option would be to install the campaign overview natively into the
  infotainment system of modern cars.  In this way a user would be the driver
  of the car, who checks the status of data sharing campaigns or consent
  agreements before or after the drive through the on-board display of his car.

  Another equally valid option is to provide a non-native application available
  on the web or for mobile devices which lets the owner of a car connect to his
  car and check information about campaign data sharing remotely and
  independently of accessing their car.

  To validate the posed research questions, it is not essential for the test to
  take place in an actual car and simulated driving environment, since the
  application should not be used while driving anyway. For these first tests we
  provide a web application which features the functionalities described in the
  above sections. The tests can be performed on desktop computers, fgsfsf
  sdfsdf laptops or other mobile devices.  The test-subject will need a
  thorough introduction into the scenario since the use case of the application
  is very specific and it is very important that the situation is understood
  correctly.

  A good understanding will be important for the test-subject to tackle the
  tasks that comprise the first part of the test.  After the introduction and
  before presenting the visualisation to the subject the answer to the
  following question should be noted: "Would you consider sharing sensor data
  of your car with chosen campaigns?"

  We then reveal the visualisation to the tester. The subject is presented with
  a series of simple to slightly complex tasks that revolve around answering
  questions about the privacy and extent of the data sharing activities.
  During the evaluation the test-subject should be observed in real time
  through screen sharing.  Using the 'think aloud' method the test subject then
  informs the tester regularly about their mental process, for example what
  they want to achieve next and where they expect to find a specific
  information in the application.

  After the task solving period, the subjects are asked to fill out a
  questionnaire where they rate their experience and explain problems or give
  suggestions for improvements.

  The questions are designed to give insights into the research questions. The
  goal is to find out whether the subject prefers the clear transparent view of
  all the data exchange happening or if it is more confusing and feels more
  invasive than being presented with a written contract which is the prevailing
  method.

  In addition we want to find out if the visualisation makes subjects more
  aware of their rights and admissions within the agreement.

  The question "In the scenario where such a visualisation is available to you
  at all times, would you consider sharing sensor data of your car with chosen
  campaigns?" will show whether the approach leads to trust gains for the data
  processor.
