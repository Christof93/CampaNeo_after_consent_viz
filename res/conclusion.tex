  In this paper we presented an application to visualise data sharing activities on the CampaNeo platform to the data owner.
  The application visualises the different campaigns which the user agreed to share vehicle sensor data with.
  It is designed in a way to present the user all the companies and institutions behind the data sharing campaigns and the concrete data retrievals in a time series visualisation.
  
  We reasoned about the different aspects of data that were visualised and the features we used to achieve it, such as the graph and time series visualisation.
  
  In a user test evaluation, we have proven that the visualisation is helpful to improve the comprehension of data privacy rights.
  40\% of the test users who did not believe that companies in the EU were respecting an individual's data privacy, changed their mind after the test with the visualisation tool, now being more convinced that user data of EU citizens can not be gathered without consent. 
  We have shown that the availability of our tool can increase data sharing consent rates for CampaNeo campaigns by up to 35\%.
  Outside of CampaNeo, more than 30\% of the test users stated that they would be more likely to share different kinds of user interaction data in services and applications of daily life when able to control it with a tool such as the presented one. 
  
  This shows that there is a need for better visualisation of data sharing streams and that people feel more comfortable to share data if they can easily oversee the exact activities in a visualisation tool. 
  
  Since this is the first design iteration of this tool, the collected feedback ideas and comments will be implemented in future iterations to enhance the interface. Another test with a bigger sample group will then be scheduled for a next prototype of the application.
